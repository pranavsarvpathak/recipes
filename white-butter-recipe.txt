1. First take milk
2. seperate the cream (drink remaining milk-don't waste)
3. Stir the cream till you see the solid component seperating from the liquid component.
4. Liquid component is chaanch. Add bit of salt to make mattha. Some people call both with the same word. It is fat free as the white butter is already seperated. Drink this as well to become strong!! unlike me :).
5. Solid component is white butter or Naudi(Nyoodi).
